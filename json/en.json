We had a go to renovate with enthusiasm and huge load of motivation right away, which proofed to be a much bigger challenge than we imagined.</p><p>The way to the current condition is a result of a journey from “all ten minutes” mini projects to full-night repairs. Both of us are going for 100% and do not compromise, so every little detail was worked out with maximum determination. We believe in continuous improvement, so we are striving to implement new ideas more and more, whether it is about making a decorative element or further developing the bar.</p><p>Making a small business a success is not one of the easiest tasks, but we think we are on the right track to achieving our goal.</p><p>We wish to provide you with at least as many joyful and unforgettable moments with our bar as we have gained during its renovation.</p>",
